                    <p>Hello! My name is Janelle Zuccarini. I am an aspiring front-end web developer in Orlando, Florida.In the past year and a half I dove head first into the world of development and coding. I began a front-end techdegree through Treehouse to freshen up on languages such as HTML5, CSS, SCSS, React, and Javascript. I have made around 8 projects and am starting a Podcast webpage for AdventHealth.</p>
                    <p>I am currently an English teacher with OCPS so I am in contact with literally hundreds of different personalities. I think this will be an advantage to me in the tech field as many projects are collaborative and team based.Working as a public school high school teacher has also helped me gain management skills, technology/on the spot decision making skills, and most importantly an abundance of patience. </p>
